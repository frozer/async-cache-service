# AsyncCacheService

The asynchronous cache service is designed to handle the storage and retrieval of data in a non-blocking manner. When data is being loaded into the cache, the service returns a Promise object to the requester. This Promise serves as a placeholder or notification that the data is currently in the process of being fetched.

Once the data loading process is complete and the data is successfully retrieved, the cache service resolves all previously issued Promises associated with that specific data. By resolving the Promises, the cache service effectively provides the updated and complete data to all subscribers or requesters who were waiting for it.

In summary, the asynchronous cache service employs Promises to handle the asynchronous loading of data, allowing subscribers to receive notifications when the data is being fetched, and resolving the Promises with the updated data once it becomes available.
